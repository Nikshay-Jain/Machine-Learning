# 🎯 Machine Learning Projects Collection
A set of concise Python and Jupyter Notebook examples covering fundamental machine learning concepts and algorithms, ideal for hands-on learning and reference.

## ✨ Features
- Classic ML algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression, and feature engineering.
- Real datasets for practice: diabetes, iris, heart disease, housing prices.
- Modular scripts and notebooks for quick experimentation and extension.

## 🚀 Quick Start/Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikshay-Jain/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning
# (Optional) Create a new environment
python -m venv ml-env
source ml-env/bin/activate        # On Windows use: ml-env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   # If requirements.txt is present, otherwise install basics:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## 🛠️ Usage
- To run a single Python script:
    ```bash
    python <scriptname>.py
    ```
- To explore notebooks:
    ```bash
    # Open Jupyter in your browser and load any .ipynb file
    jupyter notebook
    ```
- Example workflow:
    - Open `Linear Regression Univariate.ipynb`, run all cells to see step-by-step regression on sample data.
    - Try `Log_Regr.py` for basic logistic regression classification.
    - Modify `Iris.py` with your own dataset for experimentation.
